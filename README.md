🩺 Breast Cancer Detection – Deep Learning Project

Two-model system for classification and full diagnostic reporting using the CBIS-DDSM dataset

This repository contains my graduation project from the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence, Helwan University.
The project presents two complementary deep learning models built to assist radiologists in early breast cancer detection and diagnostic reporting.
📌 Project Summary

The system consists of:

1️⃣ Simple Binary Classification Model

Predicts:

Cancer Present

Cancer Absent

Built using multiple pretrained architectures, with Xception selected as the final model.
